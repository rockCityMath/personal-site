    <h2>Building an Audio Control Device</h2>
  </div>

  <p>
    I've always thought it would be cool to have a device with a few knobs and switches that can sit on your desktop and allow you to control the volume of each program you have running on 
    your computer, without having to interact with the computer itself. There are a variety of devices on the market that basically achieve this, but all of them seem to either have 
    screens, RGB LEDs, plastic construction, or various rather gaudy design choices.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've also had an interest in getting more into electronics as a hobby and building something that has a physical product design component to it. 
    While my experience with electronics was pretty slim, and I had no experience with physical product design, the idea described above seemed like a reasonable project to 
    attempt as it's based so heavily around fairly basic electronic components (buttons and knobs/potentiometers) which could give me headroom to figure out the physical product design.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout the project I documented various milestones which I list in this article along with pictures and a brief summary. While this project has a 
    software component, it is fairly simple/uninteresting so I don't discuss any of that here. I find it interesting to see how this project went from a concept 
    to a fully-realized device at the hands of someone with very little experience. I hope you feel the same, enjoy.

  <h3>For Reference</h3>

  <div class="block-quote">
    <b>Microcontroller</b> - A small computer that can interact with electronic components and communicate with a traditional computer.
    <br>
    <br>

    <b>Potentiometer</b> - An electronic component that allows a person to rotate part of it in order change its resistance value, basically allowing us to turn a knob to control the level of something (in this case, volume).
    <br>
    <br>

    <b>Sold</b> - Messing something up
  </div>

  <h3> Beginning of Aug 2024 - Start Planning </h3>
  
  <p>
    When I decided I wanted to commit to this project, I came up with a few design goals I would stick to:
    <ul>
      <li>No screens</li>
      <li>No RGB</li>
      <li>No exterior plastic</li>
      <li>No labeling</li>
      <li>The device will send the positions of switches and knobs to a computer, nothing more.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  
  <p>
    I did a small bit of prototyping to ensure I could connect a switch to a microcontroller and send that value to my computer, and everything worked as expected. Unfortunately I don't have any pictures of this.
  </p>

  <h3>Aug 24, 2024 - Get Potentiometers and Switches</h3>

  </div>

  <p>
    Elegant right? It did work though, you can see in the top portion of the enclosure (the box my mouse came in) the potentiometers and switch are soldered to some jump cables and those cables are plugged into the microcontroller. Funny enough, in this state it could basically do exactly what I want (telling my computer the position of the knob and whether a switch is on or off).

  </div>

  <p>
    Designing a PCB (printed circuit board) seemed like a good next step since there were so many wires with just 2 potentiometers and a switch, plus it didn't seem too out of reach because of the modern services that let you order personal-sized batches of custom PCBs for a pretty reasonable price. The board above allows a switch, LED, and potentiometer to be soldered in and then controlled using 5 pins at the bottom. This ended up being pretty straightforward to design and order, and got me familiar with the PCB process.
